    """Collect all bindings that could be modified by a function call

    This function iterates through the tree of struct members starting at a single parameter. When it
    encounters a pointer that is not const, it saves a reference in `results` and prunes that branch.
    
    It also keeps track of loops that the bindings may require to cover all elements in an array. It
    stores the start and end of these loops plus the name of the variable of these loops in `loops`
    and this variable is used in the returned binding strings, e.g. 'var1[i0].var2'. The bindings
    should be wrapped in the appropriate loops when used.

    It assumes that all parameters are in a const context because it stops traversal when it reaches
    a non-const reference (pointer). This assumption is violated by the fact that arrays as function
    arguments are not value types but rather syntax sugar for pointers. The decay_array parameter is
    supplied to indicate that this iteration is in the context of a function parameter and that
    arrays should be treated as reference types.

    Args:
        binding (str): the binding of the current parameter. E.g. 'member1->member2.member3'
        param (XrParam): contains information about the current parameter, mostly useful for
            for determining if this parameter is modifiable, and how to recurse to the next bindings
        loops (tuple[BindingLoop, ...]): used as an immutable list to keep track of necessary loops
            during recursion
        find_struct (Callable[[str], XrStruct]): a bound reference to spec.find_struct
        results (list): Used to collect modifiable bindings
        binding_prefix (str): the same as `binding`, up to the actual member name, used to
            contextualize variables that determine pointer length
        decay_array (bool): Whether to treat an array as decayed to a pointer, useful in the context
            of a function parameter
